# my-bashrc
Code I use to include a custom command line prompt with git functionality for a Bash shell.

###Instructions for use:
If you are on OS X, you need to add this code to your .bash_profile file, which is normally stored in your home directory ~/
If the file does not exist there, you will need to create it. If you already have a .bash_profile that you have created, you can just copy this code into the file and as long as it doesn't conflict with anything you have already done, it should work.

If you are on a Linux platform, you need to do the same, but the file will probably need to be called .bashrc

Once you copy the code into either the bashrc or bash_profile file, you need to save it and restart your terminal.

The command line used from this file follows the following format:

@user:[current-directory] [git information]

$ [prompt]
